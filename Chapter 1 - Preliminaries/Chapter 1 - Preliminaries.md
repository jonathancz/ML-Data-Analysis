**What Kinds of Data?**
When I say “data”, what am I referring to exactly? The primary focus is on **structured data**
..* It’s a vague term that encompasses many different forms
..* These forms are:
..* *Tabular* or spreadsheet-like data in which each column may be a different type (string, numeric, date, etc.). This includes most kinds of data commonly stored in relational databases.
..* *Multidimensional arrays* or matrices.
..* Multiple tables of data interrelated by key columns
..* Evenly or unevenly spaced time series
