# Python for Data Analysis
Data Wrangling with Pandas, Numpy, and Python.

This repo breaks down practical steps on how to learn Machine Learning with Python. 
It will only contain notes from the textbook.

This guide was inspired by Daniel Bourke, a Machine Learning engineer who helps others learn
machine learning by making videos on YouTube.

The general path goes like this:

## Step 1: Learn Python, Data Science tools and Machine Learning concepts

## Step 2: Learn Data Manipulation, Analysis and Visualizaation with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

## Step 3: Learn Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

## Step 4: Learn Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Step 5: Extra Curriculum & Books
